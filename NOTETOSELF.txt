1. Difference between runNSE.py and runNSE-modified.py:
	The only difference is in the processing of demo-AM. runNSE.py computes the mismatches using testing problem and the training problem. This is not how its supposed to, but thats how we get the smoothness. runNSE-modified.py fixes this but does not provide smooth results.

2. Tweaks:
	Demo-AM: 1. unvisted states are assigned 0 penalty in the training. If this is not done, then either Demo-AM performs really well as we increase the budget or there is no trend. 
		 2. Demonstrations are generated using LLAO. because generating using IF results in high NSE (because many actions are beyond slack value).
	Sample generation: Sample generation for training and testing is done using "filtered actions" in testNSE.cpp.. Although this can be generalized to use all actions, it affects "deviation". 					Deviation is actually quite good when learning with RR from samples generated this way. This does not affect the performance of any other technique except deviation.
				Therefore, it is currently set to filtered actions.


3. Run python runNSE.py navigation for *exact* driving domain results in IJCAI'20 paper.
